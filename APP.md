# App modules

* This article is only about app modules, not about sugot library itself.
* An app module modifies set of behaviours of Minecraft gameplay for single purpose.
    * e.g. app/convo has chat relay and message replacements, just for enhancing conversations.

## app/convo

* Relays to Lingr
    * Relay from Lingr is done by dynmap
* (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) Chat message replacements

## app/staging

* Anything misc is here until it finds a good spot.
